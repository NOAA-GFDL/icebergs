- Alon's Iceberg Repository, edited for initializing a model setup for testing the iceberg driver.
- 1. Initialize a berg using the scripts in one of the test directories
- 2. Use ./Scripts_and_analysis/initialize_bergs_in_pattern.py to convert the berg into a restart (input)
     file



-----------------------------------------------------------




Alon's readme:

To set up the experiments, please run the setup_ISOMIP_calving.sh script. This will create all the netcdf files which are needed to run the simulations. To run the script, write the following at the command line:

source setup_ISOMIP_calving.sh



- Building an executable:

You can create an executable using latest version of the code on dev/master, except for the coupler, which needs to be on the following branch

Repository: git@github.com:sternalon/coupler.git
Branch: passing_ustar_through_coupler

These changes to the coupler have been added to Bob's branch
Repository: git@github.com:NOAA-GFDL/coupler.git
Branch: user/rwh/redesign_flux_exchange

Note that there might be some incompatibility with the SIS code which require using a special branch. This is found on gitlab. 
Branch: sis2_interface
